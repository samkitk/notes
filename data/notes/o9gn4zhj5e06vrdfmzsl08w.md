## Purpose of a 'Now' page and why is it useful?

This is where you'll find my answer if you ask me "What are you working on?"

> ... a website with a link that says “now” goes to a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. For short, we call it a “now page”.

> It’s useful for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your site: because people on your site want to know more about you.

> Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these days?”, those who have a now page say it’s a good reminder of their priorities. By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps you say no to other requests.
