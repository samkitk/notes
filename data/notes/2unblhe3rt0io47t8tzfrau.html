<p>nohup</p>
<pre><code>Using nohup &#x3C;command> &#x26; executes command in the background 
so that you can continue to use your shell. You can use jobs -l to 
see the process identifier (PID), which will let you bring the 
process to the foreground or terminate it. nohup will redirect 
standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the file 
nohup.out.
